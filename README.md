# NON-HUMAN INTELLIGENCE DETECTOR

The **Non-human Intelligence Detector** is a forensic investigative tool designed to PROVE the authenticity of digitized human-based content. It was created by the efforts of H.S.I. (Human Super Intelligence).

### Why does it work? 
Well... machines that are designed based on mathematical logic, algorithms, and number-based formulas MUST adhere to a rigid and non-human framework.  Human-based thought is unstructured, multi-sensory, and created from associative connections within our brains. Computers *(AKA -> Artificial Intelligence)* are structured, methodological beings that cannot surpass human intuition and the paradoxical phenomenon that exists within us. **AI cannot experience reality like a human.** Here's some Food-For-Thought: How many computer-based keyboards have a hyphen as a default sentence break punctuation mark? 

### How does it work?
Regardless of prompt architecture (via prompt-engineering) or question type, ALL advanced A.I. models  are hyper-efficient and algorithmic-driven "beings". They default to the quickest solution when responding to a request, allowing them to produce an output within seconds. This is their **"key signature".** 

### Here is the identified output architecture capable in identifying Non-Human Intelligence:

1. Claim or Problem Statement
2. Explanatory Context
3. Historical or Logical Support
4. Rhetorical Question
5. Urgent Conclusion or Call to Action

The possibility of sentence structures that deviate from this pattern remain probable. However, this is only one example. More examples of blatantly obvious and subtle A.I.-Enhanced digitial content will be added to this repo.
