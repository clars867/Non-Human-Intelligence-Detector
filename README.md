# Non-Human Intelligence Detector

**Non-Human Intelligence Detector** is a forensic investigative tool designed to **PROVE the authenticity of digitized human-based content**. It was created by the efforts of **H.S.I. (Human Super Intelligence).**

### Why does it work?

Machines designed based on mathematical logic, algorithms, and number-based formulas **MUST** adhere to a rigid and non-human framework.  
Human-based thought is **unstructured**, **multi-sensory**, and full of **associative connections** within our brains.  

Computers (Artificial Intelligence) are structured, methodological beings that **cannot surpass human intuition** and **paradoxical phenomenon** that exists within us.  
AI **cannot experience** reality like a human.

**Here's some Food-For-Thought:**  
How many computer-based keyboards have a hyphen as a default sentence break punctuation mark?

### How does it work?

Regardless of prompt architecture (via prompt-engineering) or question, **ALL advanced A.I. models** are hyper-efficient and algorithmic-driven "beings".  
They find the quickest way to a solution, allowing them to produce an output within seconds.  
This is their **"key signature."**

### This is the identified output architecture that is capable of detecting Non-Human Intelligence:

1. Claim or Problem Statement  
2. Explanatory Context  
3. Historical or Logical Support  
4. Rhetorical Question  
5. Urgent Conclusion or Call to Action

The possibility of sentence structures that differ from this pattern remain probable. However, this is only one example.  
More examples of blatantly obvious and subtle **A.I.-Enhanced** digital content will be added to this repo.
